                <img src="Images\portrait.png" style="width:100 px"/><br>
                I am a business analyst who was accepted into the 
                GoForCode program at Liberty Mutual.  This is a 12 week
                Java bootcamp put on by the Software Guild. I look 
                forward to learning more coding in Java.  I have some 
                previous coding experience from my prior role.  I spent
                two years coding in c# using Visual Studio for the front-end.
                I also used SQL Server Management Studio and SQL for the 
                back-end.

            <h2>Past Experiences</h2>
            <p>
                I have an Associates in Dental Hygiene and learned a lot 
                about communication and documentation when working in this
                field for 8 years.  I got a Bachelor&#39s in Computer Science and 
                have been working in CI Finance for the last two years developing 
                small business applications for Client Development at Liberty Mutual.
